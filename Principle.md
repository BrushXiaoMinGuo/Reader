
### my most fundamental principle
we are products of our genes and our environments and approach the world with biases.  
in order to get successful, I need to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted.    
* it isn't easy for me to be confident that my opinions are right.
* bad opinions can be very costly.
* the consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker.
